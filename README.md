Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Before that, install dependencies with:

npm install
After installing, you can start the development server using the command mentioned above.

This command runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

I've added a 404 Error page for paths that are not found.

Bootstrap Framework Used
All buttons and links have been styled with CSS for hover effects.
Project Details
Created using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
It's a single-page application with all components in the src folder.
The public folder contains the HTML file.

React utilizes a virtual DOM, making it fast compared to other frameworks.
Feel free to explore and modify the project as needed! If you have any questions or encounter issues, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding! ðŸš€
